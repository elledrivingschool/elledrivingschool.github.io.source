I thought I would never pass n doubted myself all the time and Iâ€™m going to miss this lady and our weekly lessons terribly . This lovely lady made everything possible for me and yesterday I passed my test 1ST TIME with 3 minors. I would highly recommend Martine 100% she makes learning to drive fun"
